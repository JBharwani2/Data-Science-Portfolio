    "The final question to be answered is a breakdown of average cost and sex ratio by region. Earlier analysis found that were more patients in the southeast than any other region. However, using the average cost should remove any differences caused by the distribution of patients. When looking at average price alone, the southeast also has the highest average cost of any region. Patients from any part of the eastern U.S. region have a higher average cost than patients from the western U.S.\n",

However, this would not lead to higher average female costs because this region has higher average costs than other regions."

    "After analyzing this dataset of U.S. medical insurance costs, the results illustrate that there is a correlation between gender and the cost for medical insurance. The conclusion is that the average female patient spends more on medical insurance than the average male patient. In addition, the analysis shows that smoking, age, body mass index, and region have all been ruled out as factors that could alter these findings according to this dataset."
